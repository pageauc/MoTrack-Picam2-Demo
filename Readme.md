# MoTrack - Demo code for testing picamera2 libcam with legacy
### Uses python3 and opencv and Tracks largest moving object in camera view.


## Introduction
This is just some demo working code to test using picamera2 libcam library with legacy code used in some of my 
other projects like speed-camera, pi-timolo, Etc.
I will update my other projects to make compatible with picamera2 libcam python library that is currently still in development.
Still waiting for that code to mature.

In the mean time you can just clone this code if you would like to test.  Not tested with 64 bit Bullseye.

Edit config.py settings as required.
